vasm builds are unique in this template:
* The makefile goes alongside the source. 
* Also only one source file is supported which is hard coded in the makefile
* the ../common folder contains the relevant rules.

Yes this is lazy, I just included this as an example

This whole example is from @dbuchwald https://github.com/dbuchwald/cc65-tools/blob/main/tutorial/01_blink_vasm/
