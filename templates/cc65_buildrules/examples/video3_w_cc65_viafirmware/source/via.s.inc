;PURPOSE - Imports needed registers defined in via.s
;
;Future project - add the rest of the exports from via.s to make them available.
;blink.s only uses these references so we're only importing those. 
;We could import everything? I'm not smart enough to know if this has a cost on the cc65 (don't think it matters to the generated bin)
  .import VIA_DDRB
  .import VIA_PORTB
